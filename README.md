# UNC Data Bootcamp - Project 1

## Trends in Educational Attainment Across Selected Characteristics

The goal of this project is to determine whether there are trends between educational attainment and occupation across America. The questions we aim to answer through this project include whether certain occupations are more likely to complete higher forms of education. Additionally, we would like to answer if males or females are more likely to complete higher forms of education. Lastly, this project will also explore the relationship between employment rate and educational attainment. All of the data needed for this project will be provided by the US Census Survey of “Educational Attainment in the United States: 2018”.
